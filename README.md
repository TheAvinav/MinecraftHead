# MinecraftHead
A personal project, which is inspired from the Minecraft Inventory character, which follows around the cursor around the screen. This replicates that same feature, with any image, which adds on overlay to the Desktop, adding a friend to your daily, mundane activitives, turning them to slighty more engaging for the user.

Done with technical stacks, including Python and the GUI i.e. Pyqt5, and uses external images of the user's choice to use. As of now, only available on Windows and Apple, not Linux
